				An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders) to make the element "stand out".
				However, the outline property is different from the border property - The outline is NOT a part of an element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline."

				You can put any JavaScript expression within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a real JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around your program.

			The render method returns a description of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write these structures. The <div /> syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). The example above is equivalent to:
